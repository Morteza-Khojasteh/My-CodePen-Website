              <p>The only difference between oolong and wulong tea is the name. Oolong is the most recognised in Western countries, yet linguists would say that wulong is a more accurate romanisation of the original Chinese kanji.
      
      Oolong tea is also perhaps one of the widest categories of tea: according to Max Falkowitz in Serious Eats, oxidation can run between 8 and 85%. This means you will also come across vastly different flavours.

              <div class="level">GREEN TEA</div>
            <p>Green tea is only very lightly oxidised. After the initial withering, the leaves must be quickly fixed. This tends to give it a lighter profile, and it will also lose its flavour much quicker than black or oolong tea.
      
      While associated with Asia, there are significant differences between the offerings from the different Asian countries. To start with, Mary Lou and Robert J. Heiss emphasise that Chinese and Japanese green tea tastes vastly different thanks to the varieties and terroir (The Tea Enthusiast’s Handbook: A Guide to the World’s Best Teas).</p>

              <div class="level">YELLOW TEA</div>
          <p>Yellow tea is a slightly obscure but prized type of tea produced in China. It’s similar to green tea but goes through an additional yellowing phase. Kerri Shadid explains in The Daily Tea that, after fixing, the leaves are wrapped in cloth which allows slight oxidation to occur a second time. They are then slowly charcoal dried, fixing the tea one final time.</p>

                  <p>
                   Tea Farm prides itself on its high quality artisan aracha teas. Combining elements of the whole tea plant, Obubu specializes in this method as we believe goodness of the whole tea plant, resulting in less waste. Aracha teas give our teas a signature green color and bold taste that isn’t found in any other teas.

                  <p>
                    Tea Farm runs similarly to a non-profit organization, donating to several local charities and developing communities locally and globally. We strive to form a community of tea enthusiasts, businesses and farmer and bridge the gap between producer and consumer.

                  <h3>Education</h3>
                  <p>
                    Tea Farm seeks to educate its consumers on tea with its University of Tea initiative. Videos on different technical, cultural, and agriculture knowledge are provided to help introduce Japanese tea to the world! Obubu seeks to revitalize the tea industry in Wazuka, Japan and beyond.
